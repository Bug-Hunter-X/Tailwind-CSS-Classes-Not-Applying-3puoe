# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not being applied correctly.  The expected styles are not rendered, despite using what appear to be valid class names.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a potential solution.

## Bug Description
A simple div element is styled using Tailwind classes (`bg-red-500`, `p-4`, `text-white`), but the expected red background, padding, and white text do not appear. This issue occurs despite ensuring that Tailwind is properly configured and included in the project.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (if any).
3. Run the application (if applicable).
4. Observe that the styling is not applied correctly.  The div does not have a red background, padding, or white text.

## Potential Solution
The solution in `bugSolution.js` shows a workaround that fixes the issue.  This could involve double-checking Tailwind's configuration, purging unused CSS, or ensuring that the CSS is being correctly loaded and applied.
